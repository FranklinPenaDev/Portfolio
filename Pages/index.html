    <section id="about">
        <p>Hello! I'm Franklin G. Pena, a passionate <span class="title">Frontend developer</span> with over 2 years of experience crafting intuitive and engaging user experiences.
            My journey into coding began from a deep-seated fascination with technology since my early years. 
            I saw coding not just as a skill but as a lifelong tool to create impactful solutions.
            When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me delving into a good book, exploring the great outdoors through camping adventures, 
            or enjoying quality time with my loved ones. I'm also an avid sports fan, with a particular passion for baseball, basketball, soccer, and American football.</p>
